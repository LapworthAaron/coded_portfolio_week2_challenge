This project is to create a personal portfolio website, do demostrate the work i have achieved so far using all the skills i have learned thus far.
Some of the acceptance criteria for this project:
* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

Some of the elements i have accounted for:
* I have use CSS Flex boxes
* I have incorporated CSS Grids

* I have consolidated my CSS selectors
* I have used animations
* I have used links that open new tabs or default mail application
* I have designed the site to work across Mobiles, Tablets and Desktop using media queries
    * I did this using 4 seperate css files, so the css was more readable
    * I also set a reset css file
* I have made everything using accesibility standards
